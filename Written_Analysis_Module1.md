# Kicksatarting with Excel  

## Overview of Project
  In this project, decisions to start a fundraiser campaign to fund a theater plays 
  were based on an already existing dataset of over four thousand  fundraisers. 
  In the given dataset, for each fundraiser, the category, the goal amount, 
  the outcomes of the goals, and the duration of the campaigns
  with the starting and ending dates were noted.    

### Purpose
 A fundraising project was launched for the play Fever after analyzing the given dataset. 
 The project came close to it's goal in a short amount of time and then now, this particular 
 project is being compared to other fundraisers in the play category. 
 
## Analysis and Challenges
	The analysis focused on outcomes in relation to launch dates and goals. 
A pivot table was created to show the number of projects that were successful,
failed, or canceled in each month of the year. The pivot table then was filtered to show
the numbers only for theater plays. A line chart was created of the filtered pivot table to visually 
show each outcome. 
In the second part of the analysis, using the COUNTIFS function, the data pertaining to theater plays
were subdivided into categories according to their goal amount. To visualize the outcome a line chart was created. 


## Results
  
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
	The  Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date chart shows a significant spike of interest
	in helping to fund plays starting in the month of March which will 
decline to the level of outcomes at the beginning of the year. The percentage of failed 
and canceled fundraisers do not fluctuate as significantly throughout the year. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
 In the Outcomes Based on Goal chart, the graphs of the successful and failed campaigns are
 nearly inverses or mirror images of each other about the horizontal line drawn at 50%. 
 The general trends are that the lower the goals were the higher number of kickstarters were funded successfully,
 and the higher the goals were the higher number of kickstarters failed in reaching their funding.
 There are a few possible outliers, on both 
 the successful and the failed graphs, that interrupt the general trend.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	The dataset could have included how the fundraisers were advertised and what was the background 
or demography of backers. Also, the data regarding geographic locations could be more precise. Theater 
plays are more highly regarded where there are  are already established art communities. 
It seems like the data was collected globally and there is no insight what data points are relevant to Louise's location. 
	We could have created a chart or a graph on how soon the successful fundraisers reached their goals. 
With the help of a pivot table, the failed and canceled campaigns could have been sorted to show how far the actual
 amount raised was from the goals amounts. 
	With a pivot table outcomes based on the duration of the projects could have been also analyzed.
